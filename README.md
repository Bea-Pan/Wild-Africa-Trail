## About :zebra:
**Wild Africa Trail Experience** is a landing page of a fictional scientists-led travel company which brings together responsible tourism and science. The page is not based on a real-life organisation- I came up with the idea for it for the purpose of this project. Though I felt that the page was a form of a personal tribute to my own time spent in Africa and the mark it left on me.

## Methods
To achieve goals & objectives I used the follwing:
* **media queries** - I used media queries In order to make the website responsive to different types of screens and change the page layout depending on the type of device (let it be a desktop, tablet or mobile phone) 
*  **flexbox** - I used flexbox as a helping tool for the elements layout within their parent containers
*  **relative units** - I used relatives units such as rem, em or %  in relation to elements sizes.

## Technologies used
* HTML
* CSS
* Git and GitHub
* Command terminal
